# linkorb/transip-php

## What is it?

This is a repo mirroring the TransIP PHP library

## Benefits:

* A direct mirror of the library, available through git and packagist
* Made composer-ready, simply add `linkorb/transip-php` to your composer.json file
* Stripped the examples to keep it small

The original library, including examples, can be downloaded from: http://www.transip.nl/api

We created this repo to simplify including this library into your projects.

This repo is in no way affiliated with or endorsed by TransIP.

## More information

For more information regarding this library, please visit http://www.transip.nl/api/

## Maintenance

When new versions of the library are released, we intend to update this repo fast.

Contributions and pull-requests welcome!
